# Hi! This is rrrguez's GitHub page :cherry_blossom:

## I am a software engineer currently pursuing a master's degree in web development :mortar_board:

In my profile you will find mostly practises for my different subjects

My most standing out repository is [OlypmULL](https://github.com/Computational-Thinking/OlympULL), which was my Bachelor's Degree Final Project. Feel free to have a look at it!
